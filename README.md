# CoCScript
A set of AutoHotKey tools for playing clash of clans

# Many of the scripts are probably defunct now
- Much of the bot was programmed to look in specific locations ui components (which have likely changed over time).
- New units are probably not recognized by the visual neural net, so it would need more examples and retraining.
- Bluestacks has started injecting ads, likely to have changed in other significant ways.
- Main attack style, attacking low trophy bases, I've heard was balanced for, and doesn't give as many rewards now.
